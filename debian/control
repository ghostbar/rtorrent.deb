Description: ncurses BitTorrent client based on LibTorrent from rakshasa
 rtorrent is a BitTorrent client based on LibTorrent.  It uses ncurses
 and aims to be a lean, yet powerful BitTorrent client, with features
 similar to the most complex graphical clients.
 .
 Since it is a terminal application, it can be used with the "screen"/"dtach"
 utility so that the user can conveniently logout from the system while keeping
 the file transfers active.
 .
 Some of the features of rtorrent include:
  * Use an URL or file path to add torrents at runtime
  * Stop/delete/resume torrents
  * Optionally loads/saves/deletes torrents automatically in a session
    directory
  * Safe fast resume support
  * Detailed information about peers and the torrent
  * Support for distributed hash tables (DHT)
  * Support for peer-exchange (PEX)
  * Support for initial seeding (Superseeding)
