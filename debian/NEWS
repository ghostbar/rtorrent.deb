rtorrent (0.8.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  This version of rtorrent changes in an incompatible way the format of
  session files for multi-file torrents. rtorrent does not include code
  to upgrade the old files to the new format, but these packages include
  a script to perform the upgrade. Please ensure rtorrent is not running
  and do:

    $ cd /usr/share/doc/rtorrent/examples
    $ python fixSession080.py /path/to/your/session/directory
